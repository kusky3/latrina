bypass url encoding with nontrivial commands

* click on the "Go to file" button
* click on the weirdly named file
* look at the address bar

```
<marked-text data-owner-input="tree-finder-field" class="d-inline-block">$PAYLOAD</marked-text>
```
now imagine this but with the "raw" button  
one could easily induce people to execute nontrivial shell commands by simply copy-pasting the raw content url 

# bypassed

'{'
